# backend-api-library
Spring Boot application that provides RESTful endpoints for managing books. In addition to standard CRUD operations, the API will integrate with an external AI service (e.g., OpenAI) to generate insights (such as taglines or summaries) for each book.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations** for managing books.
- **Search functionality** to find books by title or author.
- **AI Insights** integration for getting book insights using an AI model.
- **Interactive API Documentation** powered by [Swagger/OpenAPI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html).

## Prerequisites

- **Java 21** or above installed.
- **Maven** to build and run the project.

## How to Build and Run

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaelrosagithub/backend-api-library.git

cd backend-api-library

mvn clean install

mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Spring Boot application on the default port 8080. You can verify that the application is running by accessing the following URL in your browser:
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/books

###  AI API integration
To integrate with AI, you need to create an account at https://platform.openai.com/ and generate an API key. Configure the key in the application.properties file in the resources folder, use the ai.api.key attribute.

### Access the API Documentation
Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation generated by OpenAPI/Swagger at the following URL:
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html

### Technology Stack
- **Spring Boot 3.4.2**: The main framework for building the backend application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Used for interacting with the database (H2 Database in this case).
- **Spring WebFlux**: Provides support for reactive programming, enabling asynchronous and non-blocking behavior, ideal for building scalable web applications and making external API calls.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For generating interactive API documentation.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database used for this project.
- **Maven**: Used for dependency management and building the project.

### Overview of design decisions
Design decisions were made following the guidelines of the requirements specified by the client, focusing on the most current versions possible of each library added to the project.
